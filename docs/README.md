  Involog
</h1>

<p align="center">
    Invoicing solution built for freelancers and small-to-medium agencies that combines accounting compliance with simplicity.
</p>

<br>
Unlike existing tools that are either overly complex or lack proper ledger maintenance, Involog automatically generates double-entry ledgers, trial balances, and other accounting essentialsâ€”without requiring users to understand accounting principles. The backend enforces proper bookkeeping, while the frontend remains intuitive and clutter-free.
