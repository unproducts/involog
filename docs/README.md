# Involog

Involog is an invoicing solution built for freelancers and small-to-medium agencies that combines accounting compliance with simplicity.

Unlike existing tools that are either overly complex or lack proper ledger maintenance, Involog automatically generates double-entry ledgers, trial balances, and other accounting essentialsâ€”without requiring users to understand accounting principles.

The backend enforces proper bookkeeping, while the frontend remains intuitive and clutter-free.
